### Steps to Reset Windows 10 Password Using Ubuntu

1. Insert a Live USB and Boot into the System  
   Insert a live USB (Kali Linux or Ubuntu) and boot your system to access the root shell.

2. Identify the Windows Partition  
   Use the following command to list all available partitions:
  
   $ lsblk
   
   Locate the Windows partition (typically /dev/sda1).

3. Mount the Windows Partition  
   Create a mount point and mount the Windows partition:
  
   $ sudo mkdir /mnt/windows
   $ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows
   

4. Backup and Replace Utility Files  
   Navigate to the System32 directory where the utility files are located:
  
   $ cd /mnt/windows/Windows/System32
   

   - Backup the utilman.exe file:
    
     sudo cp utilman.exe utilman.exe.bak
     

   - Replace sethc.exe with cmd.exe:
    
     sudo cp cmd.exe sethc.exe
     

5. Unmount the Windows Partition  
   After making the changes, unmount the partition:
  
   sudo umount /mnt/windows
   

6. Reboot the System  
   Reboot the system into Windows:
  
   sudo reboot
   

7. Reset the Windows Password  
   Once the system has rebooted and you reach the login screen, press the Shift key five times to open a command prompt window. In the command prompt, run the following command to reset the password for the user account. (Replace demo with the username and 123456 with the new password):
  
   $ net user demo 123456
   

This method allows you to reset the Windows 10 password using Ubuntu or Kali Linux. Always ensure that youâ€™re following ethical practices and have permission to make changes to the system youâ€™re working on.
